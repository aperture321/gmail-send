Now releasing gmail-send!

gmail-send allows anybody to connect to irc with a bot and a gmail address!
The process is simple:
  You define elements (username, password, channel to watch, phone #)
  Then it'll do the rest!

=======
TODO:
  escape characters?
  multiple channels
  re-assignment
  more features?
